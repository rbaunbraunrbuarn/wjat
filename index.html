        <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Anonymous source leaks White House memos. Trump exposed for Labubu conspiracy </h2>
        <p class="date">September 10, 2025</p>
        <p>Today, an anonymous source leaked a series of confidential memos from the White House. Sent via encrypted e-mail under the alias of "redtailsalmon", our source claims to be a White House staffer who strongly opposed the injustice occuring behind the scenes.</p>
        <p><embed src="Memo.pdf" type="application/pdf"width="500px" height="300px"></p>
		<p>In the document attached, there were several references made to an individual under the code-name "47" or "the client". Our Analysts at CBB News believe that these nicknames refer the the current U.S. President,<b> Donald J. Trump</b>, lining up with the fact that he is currently the 47th U.S. President. Additionally, in the memos, there seems to be handwritten messages in red ink from <i>"P.DJT"</i>, or really, President Donald J. Trump.</p>
        <p>It appears that all contents within the memos were overseen by Donald Trump. This can be concluded from several instances where the 'Deputy National Security Advisor' seems to be seeking approval from a 'higher ranking figure'.Additionally, at the end of the 3rd memo, we also see that they follow strict rules set by this superior when they mention 'Awaiting executive guidance'. </p>
        <p>There is also the mention of a company 'P' which, in light of recent events, we can safely deduce refers to 'Popmart'.Interestingly, we see mentions of financial arrangements with company P to ensure cooperation, strongly suggesting that bribery was used to pull the company into operation.</p>
        <p><i>"They tried to hide the truth, but the people deserved to know. They had taken it too far.</i><br>  - insider 'redtailsalmon' </p>
